useful again, put it there, we never know if we might need the hack again.

    This is an SQL runner that will launch the given command only if
    the used DBMS is PostgreSQL.
    It may be useful to run Postgres' specific SQL, or to take actions
    that would be non-senses with backends other than Postgre, such
    as disabling particular constraints that would prevent the migration
    to run successfully.

    See `club/migrations/0010_auto_20170912_2028.py` as an example.
