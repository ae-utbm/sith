{% trans trimmed date=last_subscription_date|date(DATETIME_FORMAT) -%}
  You received this email because your last subscription to the
  Students' association ended on {{ date }}.
{%- endtrans %}

{% trans trimmed date=dump_date|date(DATETIME_FORMAT), amount=balance -%}
  In accordance with the Internal Regulations, the balance of any
  inactive AE account for more than 2 years automatically goes back
  to the AE.
  The money present on your account will therefore be recovered in full
  on {{ date }}, for a total of {{ amount }} €.
{%- endtrans %}

{% trans trimmed -%}
  However, if your subscription is renewed by this date,
  your right to keep the money in your AE account will be renewed.
{%- endtrans %}

{% if balance >= 10 -%}
  {% trans trimmed -%}
    You can also request a refund by sending an email to ae@utbm.fr
    before the aforementioned date.
  {%- endtrans %}
{%- endif %}

{% trans trimmed -%}
  Whatever you decide, you won't be expelled from the association,
  and you won't lose your rights.
  You will always be able to renew your subscription later.
  If you don't renew your subscription, there will be no consequences
  other than the loss of the money currently in your AE account.
