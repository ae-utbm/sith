class BasketForm:
    """
    Class intended to perform checks on the request sended to the server when
    the user submits his basket from /eboutic/

    Because it must check an unknown number of fields, coming from a cookie
    and needing some databases checks to be performed, inheriting from forms.Form
    or using formset would have been likely to end in a big ball of wibbly-wobbly hacky stuff.
    Thus this class is a pure standalone and performs its operations by its own means.
    However, it still tries to share some similarities with a standard django Form.

    Example:
        ::

            def my_view(request):
                form = BasketForm(request)
                form.clean()
                if form.is_valid():
                    # perform operations
                else:
                    errors = form.get_error_messages()

                    # return the cookie that was in the request, but with all
                    # incorrects elements removed
                    cookie = form.get_cleaned_cookie()

    You can also use a little shortcut by directly calling `form.is_valid()`
    without calling `form.clean()`. In this case, the latter method shall be
    implicitly called.
